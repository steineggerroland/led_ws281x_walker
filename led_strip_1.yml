led:
  count: 90
  count_per_meter: 60
  pin: 18  # GPIO pin connected to the pixels (18 uses PWM!).
  freq_hz: 800000  # LED signal frequency in hertz (usually 800khz)
  dma: 0  # DMA channel to use for generating signal (try 10)
  brightness: 255  # Set to 0 for darkest and 255 for brightest
  invert: False  # True to invert the signal (when using NPN transistor level shift)
